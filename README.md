# Personal Blog

Welcome to my **Personal Blog** project! This is part of my coding journey where I'm building a simple, functional two-page blog site to practice working with **Web APIs** and JavaScript. The goal is to create a space where users can share thoughts, submit posts, and toggle between light/dark themes for the site.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates how to:
- Build a blog site with a **content submission form**.
- Store and retrieve blog posts using **localStorage**.
- Implement a **light/dark mode toggle**.
- Dynamically display blog posts with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## User Story

**AS** a marketing student,  
**I WANT** a personal blog,  
**SO THAT** I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.

## Features

- **Submit Blog Posts:** Users can enter their username, blog title, and content.
- **Validation:** Ensures all fields are filled before submission.
- **View Posts:** Dynamically displays submitted posts in a clean layout.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Toggle the site's theme.
- **JSON Storage:** Blog posts are saved and retrieved using `localStorage`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I load the app, I am presented with a landing page containing a form.
- When I submit the form, the post is stored in localStorage, and I am redirected to a page displaying the post.
- If the form is incomplete, I see a message asking me to complete all fields.
- On the blog page, I can toggle light/dark mode and navigate back to the form page.
- Blog posts are displayed in a list with their username, title, and content.
